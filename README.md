Tic-Tac-Toe for Android
=======================

Play Tic-Tac-Toe on your Android smartphone! This app also demonstrates how to use various Android
programming techniques. It's the main reference for the course:
[CSE 5236: Mobile Application Development](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~champion/5236).

**Caveats:**
- The maps part of the app won't work unless you get your own [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) token. You'll need to set a key-value pair, =MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=, to your token in your own =gradle.properties= file. [Mapbox's instructions](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/private-access-token-android-and-ios/#android)]
- Similarly, the Flickr Photo Gallery won't work unless you obtain a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) API token. Like before, you'll need to set a key-value pair, FLICKR_ACCESS_TOKEN, to your token in this file.
